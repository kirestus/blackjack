Ryan's Lovley blackjack game:

version 1.01
fixes:

fixed os compatibillity errors to do with system.os commands

about to incorperate betting into game

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version 1.0:
know bugs:

game does not recognize the fact that an ace can be used as 11 and a 1, right now the ace card
only counts as an ace.

formatting leaves something to be desired 

currently the players hand is displayed in a list i will have to fix that too.
